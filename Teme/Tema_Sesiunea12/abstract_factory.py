'''
Creational pattern: Abstract factory

Abstract factory - provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects
without specifying their concrete classes.

Applicability:
            - Most commonly, abstract factory method pattern is found in the sheet
              metal stamping equipment used in the manufacture of automobiles.
            - It can be used in a system that has to process reports of different categories such as
            reports related to input, output, and intermediate transactions.

PROS:
      - You can be sure that the products youâ€™re getting from a factory are compatible with each other.
      - You avoid tight coupling between concrete products and client code.
      - Single Responsibility Principle. You can extract the product creation code into one place,
      making the code easier to support.
      - Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new variants of products without breaking existing client code.

CONS:
     -  The code may become more complicated than it should be, since a lot of new interfaces and classes
      are introduced along with the pattern.

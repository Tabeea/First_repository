'''
We need to write to ensure that our code works as expected

A unit test is a way of testing unit
   - the smallest piece of code that can be logically isolated in a system
   (a function, a method, or property)

Tests should be a separated from the actual code in a folder called "tests"
Each test file should be named "test_<file_name>" where file_name is the name of the file it is testing
Each test function or class should begin with "test_" or "Test"
